# Javascript-Challenge

I imported data of previous UFO sightings and created a filter that would allow the user to imput a date to view a certain sighting using JavaScript.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
